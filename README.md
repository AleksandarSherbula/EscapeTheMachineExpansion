# EscapeTheMachineExpansion
Escape the Machine: Death Machine Returns is an expansion of my entry in olcCodeJam2020. The game has additional features from its vanilla counterpart that gives replayability to the game. The major change of this game is that it uses emscripten to run the game on browser.

Alongside playing the content that was present in a CodeJam version, there is also Time Attack and Survival. There are also new set of levels, more difficult than the original ones and they also have modes above.

Many thanks to Moros1138 for setting up all of the web related stuff, like creating server for leaderboard list, and compiling it to wasm for browser usage.

The game can be played on the link below:
